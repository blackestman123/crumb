                <h2>The History</h2>
                <p>Recorded while the band members were still students at <strong>Tufts University</strong> in Boston. This EP wasn't originally meant to be a full band project—it was a collection of songs <strong>Lila Ramani</strong> had written in high school and college. The band formed specifically to bring these recordings to life.</p>

                    <h3>01. Bones</h3>
                    <p>The introduction to Crumb’s "psych-jazz" sound. It features a heavy, walking bassline and Lila's signature ethereal vocals. It set the blueprint for their use of space and reverb.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="track">
                    <h3>02. Vinta</h3>
                    <p>A nostalgic, hazy track that feels like watching a warped tape. The rhythmic interplay between the drums and the keys showed early on that this wasn't just another indie band—they had jazz chops.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="track">
                    <h3>03. So Tired</h3>
                    <p>The "slacker-anthem" of the EP. It’s laid back, bluesy, and captures the lethargic feeling of being a college student. It remains a fan favorite for its relatable, sleepy energy.</p>
